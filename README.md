### My story
I've been programming since I was in High School, hence I started in 2015 (I was 15 then). I had a programming teacher (first-ever in my school) who taught us a couple of things. I was taught the art of algorithms using the flowchart software Raptor.
 
I was next taught Python, though I didn't get the hang of it at first, by the end of that semester I was *hooked*; and I do mean the very end quite literally. I quickly learned Python 3.6+ syntax after that and started a few projects of my own, most were hobby projects and an excuse to learn more.
In the coming semester, I was shown how to manipulate Excel files using VBA, which was fun but not as much as Python had been.
 
Later I learned how to make my basic web pages with HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript (ES6). It became my second favorite thing to do as a young programmer.
And my last year in high school, we were shown how to use ReactJS... which didn't suit me very well at the time, since I was not familiarized with classes.
 
After High School, I kept pushing my boundaries learning about classes and OOP and learning MATLAB + Arduino (for college and my career), ASP.NET Core - C# & NuGet + Angular 9 + Bootstrap 4 (my first work experience), Java SE 11 (for a videogame mod) and last, but not least, the p5.js graphics library for JavaScript.
 
Currently (March 2022 -), I've joined the Microverse curriculum, and am on my journey to make web development a part of my future professional work!


### Work Experience
