Hey! Glad you're here :D


### My story
I've been programming since I was in High School, started in 2015 (I was 15 then). I had a programming teacher (first-ever in my school) who taught us a couple of things. I was taught the art of algorithms using the flowchart software [Raptor](https://raptor.martincarlisle.com/).
I was next taught Python, though I didn't get the hang of it at first, by the end of that semester I was absolutely *hooked*; and I do mean the very end quite literally. I quickly learned Python 3.6+ syntax after that and started a few projects of my own, most were hobby projects and an excuse to learn more.
The coming semester I was shown how to manipulate Excel files using VBA, which was fun but not as much as Python had been.
Later on I learned how to make my own basic web pages with HTML 5, CSS 3 and Javascript (ES6). It became my second favorite thing to do as a young programmer.
And my last year in high school, we were shown how to use ReactJS... which didn't really suit me very well at the time, since I was not familiarized with classes.

After High School, I kept pushin my boundaries learning about classes and OOP, and learning MATLAB + Arduino (for college and my career),  C# + Angular 9 + Bootstrap 4 (my first work experience) and Java 11 (for a videogame mod).

Currently (March 2022 -) I've joined the Microverse curriculum, and am on my journey to make web development a part of my future professional work!


### Work Experience
